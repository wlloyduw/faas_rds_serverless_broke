# faas_rds_serverless

This project provides example code for working with MySQL databases from AWS Lambda.
The example shows how to connect and interact with an AWS RDS Aurora MySQL 5.6 serverless database, though the code is essentially the same for connecting to **any** MySQL database hosted anywhere.
